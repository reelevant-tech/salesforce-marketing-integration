# Salesforce Marketing Cloud Integration [SMC]

This project is a [Block Widget](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.mc-app-development.meta/mc-app-development/content-sdk.htm) for SMC's Content Builder.

A Block Widget is a simple web-hosted application iframed inside Content Builder, that use *Content Builder Block SDK*. The Content Builder SDK is a cross-document wrapper, which lets your custom blockâ€™s HTML page update the content block within the app in real time. (behind the scene it uses  [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMesage) browser's API)

This app enable direct access to Reelevant's generated blocks inside SMC.
